                <p>My favorite city is City of Manchester, England because it is a youthful, diverse, energetic and
                    bursting
                    with character; Manchester is one of the most
                    exciting cities to visit in the UK right now, offering a compelling mix of modern culture, fantastic
                    food, a
                    world-famous music
                    scene set against the backdrop of a rich industrial heritage. I'm also the soccer fan of the
                    Manchester City
                    football club and that would give me the opportunity to watch my team playing live.</p>

                <p>I would like to learn Mandarin, Spanish and German simply because they are regarded as languages that

                    prominence in the global commercial environment. And my career is also shaping in the same direction
                    of business. The second reason would be the fact that they are the most spoken languages in
                    different countries,
                    especially mandarin and spanish.</p>
