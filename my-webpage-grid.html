                        My favorite city is City of Manchester, England because it is a youthful, diverse, energetic and
                        bursting
                        with character; Manchester is one of the most
                        exciting cities to visit in the UK right now, offering a compelling mix of modern culture, fantastic
                        food, a world-famous music
                        scene set against the backdrop of a rich industrial heritage. I'm also the soccer fan of the
                        Manchester City
                        football club and that would give me the opportunity to watch my team playing live.
